# AI Labs Collection

This repository contains a collection of lab work focused on various Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts.

## Labs

*   **[Lab 1: Fake News Detection](./lab1/ReadME%20Fake%20News.md)**
    *   Focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify news articles as real or fake using TF-IDF vectorization and various classifiers. See the [Lab 1 Task](./lab1/Readme.md) for the original problem statement.
*   **[Lab 2: Object Detection with SentiSight.ai](./lab2/README.md)**
    *   Focuses on using the SentiSight.ai API via a Flask web application for object detection in user-uploaded images. See the [Lab 2 Report](./lab2/report.md) for details on setup and performance.
*   **[Lab 3: CNN Development and Training](./lab3/README.md)**
    *   Involves building and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification. This includes creating a custom CNN from scratch and applying transfer learning with a pre-trained model (MobileNetV2) on the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset. See the [Lab 3 README](./lab3/README.md) for detailed setup, modular structure, and execution instructions, and the [Lab 3 Report](./lab3/report.md) for a summary of findings.
*   **[Lab 4: Regression Analysis for Housing Prices](./lab4/README.md)**
    *   Focuses on regression analysis using the California Housing Prices dataset. Objectives include data exploration, preprocessing, and applying various regression techniques (Linear, Polynomial, Decision Trees, Random Forests, RNNs) to predict housing values.

## General Setup Notes

*   Each lab directory may contain its own specific setup instructions (e.g., `requirements.txt`, virtual environment details). Please refer to the README within each lab's folder.
*   A general `.gitignore` file is included at the root level to exclude common Python artifacts, virtual environments, and sensitive data.
