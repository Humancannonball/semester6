Objective:

Develop a system that utilizes search algorithm(s) to identify keywords within a dataset, categorize dataset elements into five groups based on these keywords, and enable users to use a search function by entering a specific phrase.

Instructions:
Use the datasets Fake.csv and True.csv provided, both containing title,text,subject,date.

System Requirements:

    Implement AI-driven search algorithm(s) to identify keywords and categorize articles into five groups (4 points).
    Include a function allowing users to input a phrase and retrieve the most relevant articles (3 points).
    Design a user-friendly interface (3 points):
        Display keyword groups and their corresponding dataset elements (you can decide in what way and how many of these elements to display).
        Provide a field for users to input a search phrase, with results presented (you can choose how many search results 3-10 to display).
