## Component Inventory & Project Ideas

This file lists various hardware components, some of which are used in the Sound Level Logger project, and some that are available for other projects or were considered.

### Available Hardware Components:

*   **Air Quality Detection Module ZP07-MP503-10 (ZP07-4 / ZP10D8K6)**
    *   *Status for SoundLevelLogger: Not Used*
    *   *Note: This is an air quality sensor.*

*   **KY-037 Microphone Sound Detection Sensor Module**
    *   *Status for SoundLevelLogger: **Used***
    *   *Note: Provides analog output proportional to sound intensity, which is logged by this project.*

*   **OV7670 Camera Module**
    *   *Status for SoundLevelLogger: Not Used*
    *   *Note: This is an image sensor.*

### General Project Idea (Related to Data Logging):

The initial concept involved creating a device for:

*   Regularly reading a parameter (e.g., temperature, sound level, etc.).
*   Storing these readings in internal EEPROM memory.
*   Providing a mechanism to manage this stored data (e.g., read data out for analysis, delete data).

This Sound Level Logger project implements this concept using the KY-037 microphone as the input sensor. The data (sound level) is stored in EEPROM and can be retrieved via the Serial Monitor for use in software like MS Excel.
